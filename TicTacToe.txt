This is a TicTacToe game.
All inputs should be done on this file, not the terminal.
When inputting values, click the end of the very last line and then write your values.
Your values should be written in the form row-column like "00" where the first number is the row number, in the range of 0-2, and the second is the column.
After you have typed your input, click "Enter" and then save the file (Ctrl/Command + S).
Have fun and don't cheat!
